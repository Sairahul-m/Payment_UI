# Payment UI – SaaS Pricing & Subscription Flow

A clean and conversion-focused SaaS pricing and checkout UI built to demonstrate frontend UX, subscription flow, and payment experience design.

This project focuses on **clarity, trust, and usability**, which are critical for real-world SaaS products.

## 💳 Project Overview

**Payment UI** is a frontend-only SaaS subscription flow that simulates how users choose a plan, proceed to checkout, and complete a payment successfully.

The project demonstrates:
- Pricing presentation
- Plan selection logic
- Checkout UI
- Success and failure states

This is a **mock payment flow** and does not process real transactions.
